      Today we continue our series on ecology and conservation with a look at a
      particularly endangered member of the black bear family.
      <span class="explainq1 explain"
        >One in ten black bears is actually born with a white coat, which is the
        result of a special gene that surfaces in a few .</span
      >
      Local people have named it ‘the spirit bear'.
      <span class="explainq2 explain"
        >And according to the legends of these communities, its snowy fur brings
        with it a special power </span
      >. Because of this, it has always been highly regarded by them - so much
      that they do not speak of seeing it to anyone else.
      <span class="explainq3 explain"
        >It is their way&nbsp;of protecting it when strangers visit the
        area.</span
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      The white bear’s habitat is quite interesting. The bear’s strong
      relationship with the old- growth rainforest is a complex one. The white
      bear relies on the huge centuries-old trees in the forest in many ways.
      For example,<span class="explainq4 explain">
        the old-growth trees have extremely long roots that help prevent erosion
        of the soil along the banks of the many fish streams</span
      >. Keeping these banks intact is important because these streams are home
      to salmon, which are the bear’s main food source. In return, the bear’s
      feeding habits nurture the forest. As the bears eat the salmon, they
      discard the skin and bones in great amounts on the forest floor, which
      provide vital nutrients. These produce lush vegetation that sustains
      thousands of other types of life forms, from birds to insects and more.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="explainq5 explain"
        >Today, the spirit bear lives off the coast of the province of British
        Columbia on a few islands.</span
      >&nbsp;There is great concern for their survival since it is estimated
      that less than two hundred of these white bears remain. The best way to
      protect them is to make every effort to preserve the delicate balance of
      their forest environment - in other words, their ecosystem.
    </p>
    <p>
      The greatest threat to the bear’s existence is the loss of its habitat.
      Over many years, logging companies have stripped the land by cutting down
      a large number of trees. In addition,
      <span class="explainq6 explain"
        >they have built roads which have fractured the areas where the bear
        usually </span
      ><span class="explainq6 explain"
        >feeds, and many hibernation sites have also been lost</span
      >. The logging of the trees along the streams has damaged the places where
      the bears fish. To make matters worse,
      <span class="explainq7 explain"
        >the number of salmon in those streams is declining because there is no
        legal limit on fishing at the moment.</span
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      All these influences have a negative impact on the spirit bear’s very
      existence,&nbsp;<span class="explainq8 explain"
        >which&nbsp;is made all the more fragile by the fact that reproduction
        among these bears has always been disappointingly low.</span
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      And so, what's the situation going forward? Community organizations,
      environmental groups and the British Columbia government are now working
      together on the problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="explainq9 explain"
        >The government is now requiring&nbsp;logging companies to adopt a
        better logging method</span
      >, which is a positive step. However, these measures alone may not be
      sufficient to ensure a healthy population of the spirit bear in the
      future.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other steps also need to be taken. While it is important to maintain the
      spirit bear’s habitat,
      <span class="explainq10 explain"
        >there also needs to be more emphasis on its expansion</span
      >. The move is justified as it will also create space for other bears that
      are losing their homes ...
