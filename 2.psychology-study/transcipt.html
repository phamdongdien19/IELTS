    <p>We’ve been discussing the factors the architect has to consider when designing domestic
        buildings. I’m going to move on now to consider the design of public buildings, and I’ll&nbsp;illustrate
        this by referring to the new Taylor Concert Hall that’s recently been completed here&nbsp;in
        the city.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>So, as with a domestic building, when designing a public building, an architect needs to
        consider the function of the building - for example, is it to be used primarily for
        entertainment,&nbsp;or for education, or for administration? The second thing the architect
        needs to think about</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>is the context of the building, this includes its physical location, obviously, but it also
        includes, the <span class="explainq1 explain">social</span> meaning of the building. how it
        relates to the people it’s built for. And finally, for&nbsp;important public buildings, the
        architect may also be looking for a central symbolic idea on&nbsp;which to base the design,
        a sort of metaphor for the building and the way in which it is used.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Let's look at the new Taylor Concert Hall in relation to these ideas. The location chosen was
        a site in a run-down district that has been ignored in previous redevelopment plans. It&nbsp;was
        occupied by a <span class="explainq2 explain">factory</span> that had been empty for some
        years. The whole area was some&nbsp;distance from the high-rise office blocks of the central
        business district and shopping centre,</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>but it was only one kilometre from the ring road. The site itself was bordered to the north
        by a <span class="explainq3 explain">canal</span> which had once been used by boats bringing
        in raw materials when the area was used&nbsp;for manufacturing.</p>
    <p>The architect chosen for the project was Tom Harrison. He found the main design challenge was
        the location of the site in an area that had no neighbouring buildings of any importance.&nbsp;To
        reflect the fact that the significance of the building in this quite run-down location was&nbsp;as
        yet unknown, he decided to create a building centred around the idea of a mystery -something
        whose meaning still has to be discovered.</p>
    <p>So how was this reflected in the design of the building? Well, Harrison decided to create</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>pedestrian access to the building and to make use of the presence of water on the site. As
        people approach the entrance, they therefore have to cross over a <span
                class="explainq4 explain">bridge</span>. He wanted to&nbsp;give people a feeling of
        suspense as they see the building first from a distance, and then</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>close-up. and the initial impression he wanted to create from the shape of the building as a
        whole was that of a <span class="explainq5 explain">box</span>. The first side that people
        see, the southern wall, is just a high, flat&nbsp;wall uninterrupted by any windows. This
        might sound off-putting, but it supports Harrison’s&nbsp;concept of the building - that the
        person approaching is intrigued and wonders what will be</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>inside. And this flat wall also has another purpose. At night-time, projectors are switched
        on and it functions as a huge <span class="explainq6 explain">screen</span>, onto which
        images are projected.</p>

                    and so are able to absorb any vibrations from outside&nbsp;and prevent them from
                    affecting the auditorium. The walls are made of several layers of&nbsp;honey-coloured
                    wood, all sourced from local beech trees. In order to improve the acoustic</p>

                    However, the evaluation of some critics has been less enthusiastic. In spite of
                    Harrison’s efforts to use local&nbsp;materials, they criticise the style of the
                    design as being <span class="explainq10 explain">international</span> rather
                    than local and&nbsp;say it doesn’t reflect features of the landscape or society
